# Hey there! 👋 Welcome to my GitHub

I'm **viclem321**, a developer who loves to explore how things work under the hood.

I'm passionate about **Full-Stack Web Development**, **Web Security**, and deeply interested in **education and pedagogy**.  
I enjoy building tools, but even more, I enjoy building tools that help others **learn**.

- [**SafeRoad (Back-end)**](https://github.com/VP-Labs/SafeRoad-back): Node.js REST API for the SafeRoad application

## 📚 Educational & Pedagogical Work

I strongly believe in making complex systems more understandable.
Whether it's through documentation, clean code, or hands-on tools, I aim to **teach by building**.

- 🧠 [**Programming Guide**](https://github.com/viclem321/null): A book-like resource for learning common programming languages and concepts (coming soon)
- ✍️ [**Writeups**](https://github.com/viclem321/null): Personal writeups with step-by-step explanations from CTF challenges (coming soon)
